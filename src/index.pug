						p In Baltimore — a city sandwiched between bigger, more glamorous cities — artists and musicians often feel like the perennial underdog. It hasn’t stopped them from creating important, resonant music, but many have wondered when their time would come.
						p Perhaps it’s here, at this very moment.
						p “Right now, it’s like there’s a light shining down on the city,” said rapper Lor Choc. “We’re finally getting noticed.”
						p Whether it’s glowing press from national tastemakers or the rash of major-label deals Baltimore artists have signed recently, her point is hard to argue. Best of all, the bar for quality continues to rise, too. Surely, great music is nothing new here, but its accessibility and reach — thanks in large part to the internet — are now global.
						p Merely a jumping-off point, we chose 10 Baltimore-area artists you need to hear today. Don’t be surprised when the rest of the world catches up.

					.artist__item.artist__text
						p The best song to rattle countless car speakers in Baltimore this past summer was Peso Da Mafia’s “Money Man,” an ode so joyful and infectious to getting rich that it spawned the #MoneyManChallenge — videos of fans shimmying their shoulders and bending their knees low in unison.

						p “We’ve always been doing it, you feel me?” Lor Dee said. “It’s just that now … we’ve got a song that goes completely with the dance.”
						p The Northeast Baltimore group recently signed with Asylum Records, a subsidiary of Warner Music Group. And with Shordie Shordie’s knack for raspy earworm hooks and PDM Purp’s cool delivery — not to mention Lor Dee’s charisma — Peso Da Mafia is confident its originality will appeal to the masses.
						p “We don’t talk like nobody else. We don’t dress like nobody else,” Shordie Shordie said.

						p Listen to: “Pray on My Knees,” a track that emphasizes Shordie Shordie’s unique voice in a deliriously off-kilter way

					.artist__item.artist__text
						p Lindsey Jordan is one of the most promising young singer-songwriters in the country, but not long ago, the recent Mount Hebron High School graduate was focused more on being a hard-hitting ice hockey enforcer.
						p “I was constantly sitting in the penalty box,” Jordan, who performs as Snail Mail, said recently from an Ellicott City coffee shop. “That was my real position.”

					.artist__item.artist__text
						p Her other loves — intricate guitar playing and songwriting — have since thrust Jordan into the indie-rock spotlight, thanks to last year’s six-song EP, “Habit,” and the subsequent positive press from Pitchfork, Stereogum and other websites. The songs show off her classically trained guitar chops, but it’s Jordan’s ability to write incisive lyrics that render the hype more than justified.

					.artist__item.artist__text
						p “Baby, when I’m 30, I’ll laugh about how dumb it felt,” she sings on “Dirt,” with a self-awareness about her adolescence many of us would envy.
						p Jordan just moved back to town from Brooklyn, N.Y., after less than two months. She didn’t pick her guitar up once up there because, she learned, home is where she feels most creative.
						p “As soon as I got back to Ellicott City, it was a total storm of inspiration,” she said.
						p Track to listen to: “Thinning,” the “Habit” opener about how hard it is to bounce back from a rut
						p What’s next: Releasing her debut album for Matador Records, produced by Jake Aron, in mid-2018

					h2 Riplay
					.artist__item.artist__text
						p In music videos like “Strange” And “Hate Me,” the chemistry of the South Baltimore R&B group Riplay is self-evident. Much of it is natural, given that the members — Marshaye “Shaye” Hebron, A’laiza “Lay” Hebron and Kiya “Ki” Hawthorne — are half-sisters. But they’ve worked at it, too.

						p “We studied a lot of groups growing up,” Hawthorne, 17, said. “We like TLC. They weren’t singing about what everyone else at the time was singing about. We look up to Destiny’s Child, their work ethic. We admire certain things about every group.”

						p “We’re trying to tell kids it’s OK to be yourself,” Hawthorne said. “That will take you a long way.”
						p Listen to: “Status,” a shimmering song with a ’90s R&B vibe

					h2 Post Pink
					.artist__item.artist__text
						p Post Pink’s 2016 eight-song EP, “I Believe You, OK,” is less than a half-hour long, but not a minute is wasted. The riff-driven, tightly constructed post-punk tracks make their impact quickly, but the effects linger.

						p “I think it’s time you left before I lose my mind,” commands Angela Swiecicki on “Take Me,” with a delivery that makes you want to heed the advice.

					.artist__item.artist__text
						p They’re halfway done writing their debut album, according to Van McAleer. The new material is darker and more serious than the EP, in a shift that will move Post Pink further away from its image as a party band, he said. What remains, though, is the band’s conciseness. There’s a magic to it that’s hard to articulate.
						p “A lot of it is just spontaneous,” Van McAleer, 32, said. “We know when it happens. We feel the excitement in it.”
						p Listen to: “Made in Mexico,” a wonderfully crafted tornado of riffs and whoa-oh-oh backing vocals in 77 seconds

					h2 Lor Choc
					.artist__item.artist__text
						p Lor Choc’s drive to succeed should resonate with anyone who’s ever been doubted.
						p “A lot of people who I crossed paths with growing up, they counted me out, like, ‘You’re never going to be nothing,’” the 19-year-old singer and rapper said recently inside a Station North coffee shop. “People who are waiting for me to fail or slip, I have to prove them wrong.”

						p This mindset explains why the Baltimore City Community College student is working toward a career in computer engineering, even as her YouTube videos rack up hundreds of thousands of views. It never hurts to a have a backup plan, she said.

					.artist__item.artist__text
						p Last year’s debut project, “Worth the Wait,” showed her musical versatility, while the catchy single “Fast Life” earned national attention from tastemakers like Noisey and the Fader. Now, she’s preparing two projects that will sound more polished and pop-friendly, she said.

					.artist__item.artist__text
						p The deliberate shift “away from the street sound” reflects her more natural instincts — said Choc, whose favorite artists are Lauryn Hill and Indie Arie — but also her drive to find a wider audience, and ultimately, greater success.
						p “For 19 years, I’ve been looking at the same brick walls,” said Choc, who lives in the Gilmor Homes public housing community. “I just want to be known for beating the odds.”
						p Track to listen to: “Fast Life,” whose catchy hook shows off Choc’s singing voice
						p What’s next: Releasing the R&B-focused “Love/Love” project, then a sequel to “Worth the Wait” next year

The day before, the rising rapper from Sandtown-Winchester took a rare break from the studio to celebrate his 23rd birthday — “my Jordan year,” he said — with some shopping in New York, but he couldn’t stay away from the studio for long.

						p “If you work at something you love 365 days out of the year, good things should come out of it,” he said.
						p The fruits of Tay’s labor can be heard on October’s “Rich Before Rap 2,” a mixtape sequel but also “the first effort I put my all into,” he said. On highlights like “Lit Up” and “Trappin,” the MC — born Davante Harrison — shows his penchant for instantly hummable choruses — a skill Tay believes will lead to stardom.

					h2 Us and Us Only
					.artist__item.artist__text
						p Restraint rarely comes easily in rock music, yet it’s the most striking aspect of the debut album released in July from Us and Us Only.
						p On “Full Flower,” the Baltimore quintet is crafty with soft-to-loud dynamics, and always sounds in complete control of the pace — perhaps in spite of lead singer and guitarist, Kinsey Matthews.
					.artist__item.artist__video
						.iframeWrapper

					.artist__item.artist__text
						p “I was always used to playing the loudest, playing the fastest,” the Charles Village-via-Westminster 28-year-old said. “It’s nice that these folks will pull me back.”
						p The album’s title track captures the band’s effectiveness. The unvarnished verses crawl at a pace set by drummer Sean Mercer until the chorus welcomes a distorted, full-band onslaught, all tied together by Matthews’ hook that would sound at home on a ’90s alt-rock station. (Other members include violinist/keyboardist Mike Suica, bassist Nick Hughes and guitarist John Toohey.) It’s at once subtle and powerful.

						p Rap, though, wasn’t something he heard much growing up in Northwest Baltimore.
